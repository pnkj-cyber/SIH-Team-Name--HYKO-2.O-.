## 📖 Project Overview  
**HYKO 2.0** is a next-generation **civic reporting and issue tracking platform** designed to empower citizens, communities, and governing bodies.  
Our mission is to **bridge the gap between citizens and authorities** by making issue reporting simple, transparent, and action-oriented.  

This platform allows people to **report civic issues** such as:  
- 🏙️ Broken infrastructure (roads, streetlights, drainage)  
- 🌫️ Pollution (air, water, soil, noise, plastic, e-waste)  
- 🚮 Waste mismanagement (garbage hotspots, lack of recycling)  
- 🛡️ Crime & safety concerns (unsafe areas, theft, harassment)  
- ⚡ Public services (electricity, transport, water supply)  

By combining **real-time reporting, analytics, and community participation**, HYKO 2.0 ensures that problems do not remain hidden — they are **heard, tracked, and resolved**.
