    <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my Civic Reporting platform – a space created for every citizen who believes that change begins with awareness and action. Our cities face challenges every day: pollution that harms our environment, waste that piles up in our streets, infrastructure that needs repair, and crimes that threaten safety. This website is designed to bridge the gap between citizens and authorities, making it easier for you to report issues, track complaints, and contribute to meaningful solutions.
Civic reporting is more than pointing out problems – it is about building responsibility and creating impact. Every photo you upload, every report you file, and every voice you raise is a step toward cleaner streets, safer communities, and stronger infrastructure. By working together, citizens and local bodies can transform problems into opportunities, and complaints into progress.
This platform empowers you to become an active participant in governance. It gives you the tools to highlight problems, suggest improvements, and ensure accountability. Whether it’s a broken streetlight, an overflowing garbage bin, unsafe construction, or an act of public misconduct – your report matters. With every action, we move closer to a city that is cleaner, safer, smarter, and more sustainable.
Together, let’s shape a future where every complaint counts, every voice is heard, and every city becomes a better place to live. Welcome aboard – because your city needs you, and your voice can make the difference.</p>

Civic Reporting is about participation, responsibility, and progress. We believe that every complaint is not just a problem—it’s an opportunity for change. By reporting issues related to pollution, crime, infrastructure, and waste, citizens become active partners in governance. This platform ensures transparency, accountability, and collective problem-solving, making our city more livable and sustainable.    </p>

  <legend>Pollution</legend>
  <p>Pollution is a silent destroyer of health, environment, and quality of life. From air filled with harmful emissions to rivers contaminated with industrial waste, pollution touches every aspect of civic life. Reporting pollution helps authorities take swift action against offenders, reduce health risks, and promote cleaner practices. Every report you make contributes to building a healthier city for future generations.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Air Pollution</li>
    <li>Water Pollution</li>
    <li>Plastic Pollution</li>
    <li>Noise Pollution</li>
  </ul>

  <legend>Infrastructure</legend>
  <p>Infrastructure is the backbone of any thriving city. Roads, bridges, public transport, water supply, and sanitation systems are essential for daily life and economic activity. When infrastructure fails, it disrupts communities and hampers growth. By reporting infrastructure issues, citizens help prioritize repairs, upgrades, and maintenance. Your reports lead to safer roads, reliable utilities, and improved public services that enhance the quality of urban living.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Road Issues</li>
    <li>Water Supply Problems</li>
    <li>Building Safety Concerns</li>
    <li>Public Transport Complaints</li>
  </ul>
  <legend>Crime</legend>
  <p>Crime affects the safety and well-being of communities. From petty thefts to
  serious offenses, crime undermines trust and quality of life. Reporting crime helps law enforcement agencies respond quickly, investigate thoroughly, and prevent future incidents. Your vigilance and reports are crucial in creating safer neighborhoods where everyone can live without fear.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Urban Crime</li>
    <li>Social Crime</li>
    <li>City Crime</li>
    <li>Public Safety</li>
    <li>Justice & Crime</li>
  </ul>
  <legend>Waste Management</legend>
  <p>Effective waste management is vital for a clean and sustainable city. Improper disposal of waste leads to pollution, health hazards, and environmental degradation. By reporting waste management issues, citizens help authorities identify problem areas, improve collection services, and promote recycling initiatives. Your reports contribute to cleaner streets, healthier communities, and a greener future.</p>
